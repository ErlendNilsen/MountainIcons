Our research lab conduct research on a wide range of topics. Most of them are related to population dynamics and trophic interactions of alpine vertebrate species.

Our study species include iconic bird species, including willow ptarmigan (*Lagopus lagopus*) and rock ptarmigan (*Lagopus muta*), raptors such as gyrfalcon (F*alco rusticolus*) and golden eagles (*Aquila chrysaetos*), and taiga been goose (*Anser fabalis*). We are also involved in research on a range of other species (both avian and mammals) and systems, both in mountain ecosystems and other ecosystems.
